   NAME
          conda - conda uninstall
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage:  conda  uninstall [-h] [-y] [--dry-run] [--json] [--all] [--fea‐
          tures]
   
          [--no-pin] [-c CHANNEL] [--override-channels]
                 [-n NAME  |  -p  PATH]  [-q]  [--use-index-cache]  [--use-local]
                 [--offline] [package_name [package_name ...]]
   
          uninstall  a list of packages from a specified conda environment.  Nor‐
          mally, only the specified package is  removed,  and  not  the  packages
          which  may  depend  on  the package.  Hence this command should be used
          with caution.  Note that conda uninstall is an alias for conda remove
   
      positional arguments:
          package_name
                 package names to uninstall from environment
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 show this help message and exit
   
          -y, --yes
                 do not ask for confirmation
   
          --dry-run
                 only display what would have been done
   
          --json report all output as json. Suitable for using conda programmati‐
                 cally.
   
          --all  uninstall all packages, i.e. the entire environment
   
          --features
                 uninstall features (instead of packages)
   
          --no-pin
                 don't use pinned packages
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.binstar.org/
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
   
          -n NAME, --name NAME
                 name of environment (in envs dirs)
   
          -p PATH, --prefix PATH
                 full  path to environment prefix (default: envs dirs/build-envi‐
                 ronment)
   
          -q, --quiet
                 do not display progress bar
   
          --use-index-cache
                 use cache of channel index files
   
          --use-local
                 use locally built packages
   
          --offline
                 offline mode, don't connect to internet
   
      examples:
                 conda uninstall -n myenv scipy
