   NAME
          conda - conda inspect linkages
   
   DESCRIPTION
          usage: conda-inspect linkages [-h] [--untracked] [--show-files] [--all]
   
          [-n ENVIRONMENT | -p PATH]
                 [packages [packages ...]]
   
          Investigate  linkages  of  binary libraries in a package (only works in
          Linux and OS X). Aggregates the output of ldd (on Linux) and  otool  -L
          (on  OS  X).  Useful  for finding broken links, or links against system
          libraries that ought to be dependent conda packages.

                 Show the files in the package that link to each library
