      positional arguments:
          RECIPE_PATH
                 path to recipe directory
   
      optional arguments:
          -h, --help
                 show this help message and exit
   
          --check
                 only check (validate) the recipe
   
          --no-binstar-upload
                 do not ask to upload the package to binstar
   
          --output
                 output the conda package filename which would have been  created
                 and exit
   
          -s, --source
                 only obtain the source (but don't build)

                 test package (assumes package is already build)
   
          --no-test

          -b, --build-only
                 only  run  the  build,  without  any post processing or testing.
                 Implies --no-test and --no-binstar-upload
   
          -p, --post

          --python PYTHON_VER
                 Set the Python version used by conda build
   
          --perl PERL_VER
                 Set the Perl version used by conda build
   
          --numpy NUMPY_VER
                 Set the NumPy version used by conda build
   
          --R R_VER
                 Set the R version used by conda build
   
          -c CHANNEL, --channel CHANNEL
                 Additional  channel  to  search  for  packages.  These  are URLs
                 searched in the order they  are  given  (including  file://  for
                 local directories). Then, the defaults or channels from .condarc
                 are searched (unless --override-channels is given). You can  use
                 'defaults'  to  get the default packages for conda, and 'system'
                 to get the system  packages,  which  also  takes  .condarc  into
                 account.  You  can  also  use  any  name  and the .condarc chan‐
                 nel_alias value will be prepended. The default channel_alias  is
                 http://conda.anaconda.org/.
   
          --override-channels
                 Do not search default or .condarc channels. Requires --channel.
