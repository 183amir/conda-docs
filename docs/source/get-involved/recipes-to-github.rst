Contribute recipes to Github
============================

The GitHub repository at https://github.com/conda/conda-recipes is always happy to 
accept new recipes for programs not yet there. Building recipes is described in 
the :doc:`../build`. When you build a new conda recipe for a program not yet listed 
in the repository, please use a GitHub pull request to submit it to the repository, 
so that others using that program in the future can reuse it. Recipes are welcome 
for programs that use any license, whether GPL, BSD, MIT, Apache, or any other, and 
all of the recipes in this repository are released into the public domain.
